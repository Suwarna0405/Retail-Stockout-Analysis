# Retail-Stockout-Analysis
**Updated Project Description (Group Work + My R Contribution)**

This project originated as a group-based university assignment focused on analyzing and reducing stockouts in retail using the Six Sigma DMAIC framework. While the my group completed the primary analysis using Python, I took the initiative to individually replicate and extend the analysis in R to deepen my understanding of both the business problem and data analysis techniques.

As part of my individual contribution, I implemented the full DMAIC process in R (compatible with older versions), performing:
1. Descriptive statistics using base R and dplyr
2. Stockout calculation using logical filtering
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) through ggplot2 charts
4. Heatmaps, bar plots, and Pareto analysis to visualize patterns across product categories, stores, seasons, and promotional events

The dataset used includes over 76,000 observations across five major product categories, incorporating external factors like weather, promotions, and seasonality. Using R, I developed insights into:
1. The impact of seasonal demand on stockouts
2. How promotional campaigns influence both sales and inventory pressure
3. Which stores and categories contributed most to inventory issues

My R implementation aligned with the group’s findings, while adding new visualizations and statistical summaries that enhanced the report’s depth. I also proposed improvement strategies such as:
1. Dynamic safety stock levels
2. ABC SKU segmentation
3. Promotion-aware forecasting models
4. Weekly control charts for tracking stockout trends

This work demonstrates my ability to:
1. Work within a team on large-scale analytics projects
2. Take ownership of technical execution using different tools (Python and R)
3. Apply structured problem-solving (DMAIC) to real-world retail challenges
4. Deliver reproducible, code-based analysis independently
