# 🛍️ Retail Demand Analysis – Reducing Stockouts with R & Six Sigma DMAIC

>  A data-driven inventory analysis project to understand and reduce stockouts in retail stores using R and the Six Sigma DMAIC framework.

```

```{r}
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying, analyzing, and reducing **stockouts** (out-of-stock events) in a simulated retail dataset. By applying the **DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)** method, we explore how promotions, seasonality, and product categories affect inventory performance.

The project uses **R programming** (compatible with older versions) to process and visualize over 76,000 observations from 5 product categories across multiple stores.

```

```{r}
## 🎯 Objectives

- Quantify stockout rates across products and stores
- Analyze seasonal and promotional impacts on sales and inventory
- Visualize stockout patterns with heatmaps, bar plots, and Pareto charts
- Recommend improvements like dynamic safety stock, SKU segmentation (ABC), and promotion-aware forecasting

```

```{r}
## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **R (base R, compatible with R 3.x)**
- **ggplot2** – for visualizations
- **dplyr** – for data aggregation and transformation
- **reshape2** – for creating pivot tables and heatmaps

```

```{r}
##  Dataset

-  **Source:** [Kaggle - Retail Store Inventory and Demand Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atomicd/retail-store-inventory-and-demand-forecasting)
- **Period:** January 2022 – January 2024
-  **Observations:** 76,000 rows, 17 variables  
-  **Product Categories:** Electronics, Clothing, Groceries, Toys, Furniture

```

```{r}
## 📉 Key Metrics

- **Stockout Definition:** Inventory Level == 0  
- **Overall Stockout Rate:** Calculated as `% of rows with stockout`
- **Group Analysis:** By `Store`, `Product`, `Season`, and `Promotion`
```

```{r}
## 📊 Visualizations

-  **Heatmap** – Average stockout rate by Store x Product
-  **Bar Plot** – Stockouts per Store-Product pair
-  **Seasonal Impact** – Sales and stockouts by season
-  **Promotion Impact** – Sales and stockouts by promotion status
- **Pareto Chart** – Stockouts by category
```

```{r}
##  Summary of Results

- Highest stockouts observed in **Groceries**, especially during **Winter and promotional periods**
- Promotions increase sales but also raise risk of stockouts
- Stores have varying performance in stockout rates due to possible planning issues
```

```{r}
## 🛠️ Suggested Improvements

-  **Seasonal forecasting models** for peak periods  
- **Promotion-aware forecasting engine**  
-  **Dynamic safety stock calculation** based on demand volatility  
- ️ **ABC SKU classification** to focus inventory management  
-  **Weekly KPI dashboards using P-charts**
